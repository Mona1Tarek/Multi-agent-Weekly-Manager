Title: 	Agentic AI Weekly Management System
	Agentic AI Weekly Manager
	Multi-agent AI Weekly Manager




Tasks:  Task Orchestrator → Agent decides which one to call based on your query
	Email Drafting Agent 
	Calendar Agent → books meetings
	Timetable Agent → organizes your week
	Summarizer Agent → shortens documents
	Reminder Agent 
	Reporting Agent




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Medium level (context sharing)

Agents share results with each other via the orchestrator.


Example:
Summarizer Agent finishes → output goes to Reporting Agent.
Calendar Agent updates a meeting → Reminder Agent automatically gets notified.
This makes the system feel more cohesive and useful.

Needs a bit more design (like a shared memory or message-passing system).





Hard level (true collaboration)

Agents work together in a workflow chain (like Crew AI).


Example:
Summarizer Agent extracts key info from a report.
Reporting Agent formats this into a weekly digest.
Email Draft Agent prepares a message with that digest.
Orchestrator passes the draft to you for review.

This is powerful, but more complex (requires defining flows, error handling, and dependencies).

Money-Wise



1. LLM Backend
Groq + Llama models (free tier or very cheap) → Groq provides high-speed inference for open-weight models (like Llama-3, Mistral, Gemma), often free or with generous quotas.

Other options:
Ollama (local models) → completely free if the laptop can handle it.
HuggingFace Inference API (free tier) → good for trying smaller models.
LM Studio → run models locally without coding too much.



2. APIs:
Google Calendar API → free within generous limits.
Gmail API → also free.



3. Frameworks / Tools:
LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen → all free and open source.
ChromaDB, SQLite → free for storing tasks/summaries.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Groq:

Runs in the cloud → sending prompts to their API, they send back results.
Very fast inference (that’s their main advantage).
Good for heavy LLM tasks like summarization, drafting long emails, or multi-agent reasoning.
Risk: needs internet + depend on their service.



Ollama:

Runs locally 
Works offline (good for privacy or no-internet use).
Supports quantized models (3B–7B–13B).
Slower than Groq unless for a strong machine.
Limited in context length + quality compared to bigger cloud models.




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Task Orchestrator Agent (CrewAI):

Defines roles (Email Agent, Calendar Agent, Summarizer, etc.).
Manages the workflow: e.g., “Summarizer Agent → output → Calendar Agent → output → Reporting Agent.”




Summarizer Agent (CrewAI role + LangChain inside):

Inside this agent, using LangChain to:
Load documents (PDF, DOCX, etc.)
Run embeddings + vector search (ChromaDB, FAISS)
Summarize using Groq / Ollama.




Email Agent (CrewAI role):

But when generating emails, it can call a LangChain prompt template that ensures structured output.




Timetable Agent (CrewAI role):

Could use LangChain’s date/time tools or external APIs to build the schedule.




Calendar Agent:

CrewAI role: Handles “calendar management.”
Receives tasks from Orchestrator (e.g., schedule weekly meeting).
Coordinates when to call APIs.

LangChain inside:
Uses Google Calendar API wrapper (LangChain has tools for APIs) to create/update events.
Could use LangChain’s natural language parsing to extract dates/times from your query (“next Friday 5pm” → structured datetime).

Flow: Orchestrator → Calendar Agent → (LangChain date parser + Calendar API).




Reporting Agent:

CrewAI role: Responsible for end-of-week / daily summary reports.
Collects inputs from other agents (Calendar → what meetings you had, Email Agent → what drafts were made, Timetable → tasks done/pending).

LangChain inside:
Summarizes logs (using LLM summarization pipeline).
Optionally organizes into a Markdown or PDF report.
You could even add ChromaDB memory to store weekly history and show trends.

Flow: Orchestrator → “Generate report” → Reporting Agent pulls from each agent → LangChain summarizer → output.




Reminder Agent:

CrewAI role: Keeps track of upcoming deadlines / events.
Listens to Calendar Agent’s output.
Sends you reminders (via email draft, notification, or even console output).

LangChain inside:
Could format reminder messages with a template (e.g., polite, concise, etc.).
Could prioritize which reminders are urgent vs. informational.

Flow: Calendar Agent shares event list → Reminder Agent checks thresholds (e.g., 1 hour before, 1 day before) → LangChain formats reminder → output.
