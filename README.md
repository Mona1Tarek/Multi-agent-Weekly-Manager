# Multi-agent Weekly Manager

## Overview
The Multi-agent Weekly Manager is an AI-powered system designed to assist with weekly management tasks using multiple specialized agents. The system utilizes both CrewAI and LangChain frameworks to implement a robust task management solution. 

The system leverages the Groq API with the Llama 3.1 language model for optimal performance and response times.

## Features
- **Summarizer Agent**: Processes PDF documents and generates concise summaries in PDF format, with implementations in both CrewAI and LangChain for comparison.
- **Timetable Agent**: Creates detailed weekly schedules based on user-provided tasks and priorities, also implemented in both frameworks.
- Planned Agents:
  - Email Drafting Agent: Drafts emails based on summarized content.
  - Calendar Agent: Manages and books meetings.
  - Reminder Agent: Sends reminders for upcoming tasks and events.
  - Reporting Agent: Generates weekly or daily summary reports.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- API keys for Groq and AgentOps (stored in a `.env` file)

### Dependencies
Install required Python packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- crewai: For agent orchestration and task management
- langchain and related packages: For alternative implementation and document processing
- python-dotenv: For environment variable management
- fpdf2: For PDF generation
- PyPDF2: For PDF reading and text extraction
- agentops: For agent operations tracking (optional)
- langchain-groq: For Groq API integration

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following keys:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
AGENTOPS_API_KEY=your_agentops_api_key_here
```

## Usage
1. Place the PDF documents you want to summarize in the `input/` directory (use `sample.pdf` as an example).
2. Open `main.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment and configure your tasks in the `schedule_text` variable using the format:
   ```
   - Task 1: Complete project report (High Priority, 2 hours)
   - Task 2: Team meeting (Medium Priority, 1 hour)
   ```
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute both CrewAI and LangChain implementations.

Output files will be generated in the `output/` directory:
- `summary.pdf`: Document summary generated by CrewAI
- `timetable.pdf`: Weekly schedule generated by CrewAI
- `langchain_summary.pdf`: Alternative summary using LangChain
- `langchain_timetable.pdf`: Alternative schedule using LangChain

This allows you to compare the outputs from both implementations.
