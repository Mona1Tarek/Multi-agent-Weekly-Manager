# Multi-agent Weekly Manager

## Overview
The Multi-agent Weekly Manager is an AI-powered system designed to assist with weekly management tasks using multiple specialized agents. The system utilizes both CrewAI and LangChain frameworks to implement a robust task management solution. 

The system leverages the Groq API with the Llama 3.1 language model for optimal performance and response times.

## Features
- **Summarizer Agent**: Processes PDF documents and generates concise summaries in PDF format, with implementations in both CrewAI and LangChain for comparison.
- **Timetable Agent**: Creates detailed weekly schedules based on user-provided tasks and priorities, also implemented in both frameworks.
- **Email Drafting Agent**: (Experimental) Drafts emails using Gmail API integration with LangChain.
- Planned Agents:
  - Calendar Agent: Manages and books meetings.
  - Reminder Agent: Sends reminders for upcoming tasks and events.
  - Reporting Agent: Generates weekly or daily summary reports.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- API keys for Groq and AgentOps (stored in a `.env` file)
- Google OAuth credentials (for Gmail integration features)

### Dependencies
Install required Python packages using pip:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- crewai: For agent orchestration and task management
- langchain and related packages: For alternative implementation and document processing
- python-dotenv: For environment variable management
- fpdf2: For PDF generation
- PyPDF2: For PDF reading and text extraction
- agentops: For agent operations tracking (optional)
- langchain-groq: For Groq API integration
- google-auth-oauthlib: For Google OAuth authentication
- google-api-python-client: For Gmail API integration

### Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following keys:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
AGENTOPS_API_KEY=your_agentops_api_key_here
```

### Gmail Integration Setup 
For email drafting features:
1. Create a Google Cloud project
2. Enable the Gmail API
3. Download OAuth 2.0 credentials and save as `credentials.json`
4. Run the authentication flow (will create `token.json`)

## Usage

### Running the Agents
1. Place the PDF documents you want to summarize in the `input/` directory (use `sample.pdf` as an example).
2. Open `main.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment and configure your tasks in the `schedule_text` variable using the format:
   ```python
   schedule_text = """
       - Task 1: Complete project report (High Priority, 2 hours)
       - Task 2: Team meeting (Medium Priority, 1 hour)
       - Task 3: Respond to emails (Low Priority, 30 minutes)
   """
   ```
3. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute both CrewAI and LangChain implementations.

### Output Files
Output files will be generated in the `output/` directory:
- `summary.pdf`: Document summary generated by CrewAI
- `timetable.pdf`: Weekly schedule generated by CrewAI
- `langchain_summary.pdf`: Alternative summary using LangChain
- `langchain_timetable.pdf`: Alternative schedule using LangChain

This allows you to compare the outputs from both implementations.

## Implementation Details

### Summarizer Agent
- Reads PDF content using PyPDF2
- Extracts key points and main ideas
- Generates concise summaries
- Outputs clean, formatted PDFs without markdown artifacts

### Timetable Agent
- Analyzes task priorities and durations
- Distributes tasks across the week
- Includes breaks and buffer time
- Creates structured table format with columns: Day, Time Slot, Task, Duration, Priority

### Email Drafting (Experimental)
- Integrates with Gmail API
- Creates draft emails programmatically
- Requires proper OAuth authentication
- Currently in development phase

## Notes
- AgentOps integration is commented out by default but can be enabled for monitoring
- The system handles encoding issues automatically for PDF generation
- Both CrewAI and LangChain implementations are provided for comparison and flexibility
- Gmail features require additional setup and may not work without proper credentials
